3D Model Marketplace DApp
Overview
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) built on Ethereum that allows users to list, purchase, and rate 3D models. It utilizes Web3.js to interact with smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The frontend is designed to work with MetaMask for Ethereum account management.

Features
List Models: Users can list their 3D models with a name, description, and price.
Purchase Models: Users can purchase listed models by sending Ether.
Rate Models: Users can rate models after purchasing them.
Withdraw Funds: Creators can withdraw their earnings from model sales.
Model Display: Users can view a list of all models with details including price, creator, and average rating.
Requirements
Node.js (to run the application)
MetaMask (browser extension for managing Ethereum accounts)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-model-marketplace.git
cd 3d-model-marketplace
Install dependencies: Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. If you're using a package manager like npm, you can set it up as follows:

bash
Copy code
npm install web3
Set up the smart contract: Make sure to deploy your smart contract to an Ethereum test network (like Rinkeby or Ropsten) and update the contractAddress variable in the code with your contract’s address.

Add ABI File: Ensure the abi.json file is present in the project root directory. This file should contain the ABI of your deployed smart contract.

Usage
Start the application: You can serve your HTML file using a local server or any static file server. If you’re using http-server, run:

bash
Copy code
npx http-server
Open your browser: Navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port your server uses).

Connect MetaMask: Ensure you have MetaMask installed and set to the correct network where your contract is deployed. You will need to grant the application permission to access your accounts.

Interacting with the DApp:

List a Model: Fill out the form with the model's name, description, and price in Ether, then submit it.
Purchase a Model: Enter the model ID you want to purchase and click the purchase button.
Rate a Model: Enter the model ID and the rating you wish to give.
Withdraw Funds: Click the withdraw button to withdraw any funds earned from sales.
Code Structure
index.html: The main HTML file containing the user interface.
app.js: The main JavaScript file that contains the logic for interacting with the smart contract.
abi.json: The ABI of the smart contract.
